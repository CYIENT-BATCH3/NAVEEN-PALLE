Alogorithm:

1.start

2.set configuration bits for PIC18f458.

3.set crystal frequency to 2mhz.

4.perform functions for CAN operations modes like set mode,get mode,initialize,,set baud rate,set mask

  set filter mask, CAN read and CAN write.

5.consider a message of 0x432 to ECU of bus master is tranmsmitted in that bits 3 to 7 consider as data (AA).

  Other bits consider as 0x00.

6.consider another message of 0x932 from other ECU for recieving purpose.here the the third bit is considerd for

  checking the status of the door.

7.if the message ID 432 from ECU1 is true then the reciever ECUs third bit will tell the staus of the door.

8.the door status be 0x01 for opening of door and 0x00 for closing of door.

9.stop.
